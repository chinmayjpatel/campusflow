# Accessibility checklist

- Keyboard operability: search input, filters, and event list items are reachable and actionable via keyboard.
- Focus management: Event detail view moves focus to the title and restores focus on exit.
- Live regions: search and filter updates announce the current event count via an aria-live region.
- Semantic structure: primary heading identifies the page and form controls include associated labels.
- Safe links and downloads: external links include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and calendar downloads use descriptive button text.
